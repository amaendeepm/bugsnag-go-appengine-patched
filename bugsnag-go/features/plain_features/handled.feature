Feature: Plain handled errors

Background:
  Given I set environment variable "API_KEY" to "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And I configure the bugsnag endpoint
  And I have built the service "app"
  And I set environment variable "AUTO_CAPTURE_SESSIONS" to "false"

Scenario: A handled error sends a report
  When I run the go service "app" with the test case "handled"
  Then I wait to receive a request
  And the request is a valid error report with api key "a35a2a72bd230ac0aa0f52715bbdc6aa"
  And the event "unhandled" is false
  And the event "severity" equals "warning"
  And the event "severityReason.type" equals "handledError"
  And the exception "errorClass" equals "*os.PathError"
  And the "file" of stack frame 0 equals "main.go"
