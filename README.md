# bugsnag-go-appengine-patched
Patched working version of Bugsnag GO Appengine support lib ( Not supported by Anyone, but works )

Since official support for AppEngine GO lib has been withdrawn since this commit (https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-go/pull/109 ), this is patched local working version shared here only for education and exploration purpose with all other artefacts intact

This is not supported, but comments/improvisations welcome :)
